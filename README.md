This is first basic version of project.

As for now in plans are:

- adding blob field support;
- firebird events;
- transaction control.

## Getting Started

You will need:
 NodeJS (tested with v0.3.2-pre)
 Firebird (tested with v2.5)

 All things below were tested on CentOS 5.5.
 
Get Firebird:
 
 wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/firebird/firebird-linux-i386/2.5-Release/FirebirdCS-2.5.0.26074-0.i686.rpm 
 rpm -ivh FirebirdCS-2.5.0.26074-0.i686.rpm 

Update your path: 
 export PATH=$PATH:/opt/firebird/bin

Create some Database: 
    isql -user sysdba -password masterkey
    CREATE DATABSE 'test.fdb';
    CONNECT 'test.fdb';
    CREATE TABLE TEST (id integer, name varchar(50));
    exit;
 
Play with it from node:

    var fb  = require("./firebird"),
    sys = require("sys"); 
    var con = fb.createConnection();
    con.connectSync('test.fdb','sysdba','masterkey','');
    con.querySync("insert into test (id,name) values (5, 'new one')");
    var res = conn.querySync("select * from test");
    var rows = res.fetchSync("all",true);
    console.log(sys.inspect(res));
 
 
## Reference

 createConnection() method will create Firebird Connection object for you
 
### Connection object

Handles database connection and queries. Supports Synchronous and Asynchronous operation.

#### Connection object members
* * *
    function connectSync(database, username, password, role);

where 

* database - string, a database name in Firebird notation, i.e. <hostname>:<path to database file | alias>
* username - string, user name
* pasword - string,
* role - string;

Connects you to database, raises exception on error (try to catch it).
Returns undefined.

* * *
    function connect(database, username, password, role, callback);
    
where first four parameters same as in connectSync()

* callback - function(err), where err is error object in case of error.

Asynchronously connects you to Database.
Returns udefined.

* * *
    connected;
A boolean readonly property indicating if Connection object is connected to database

* * *
    function querySync(sql);
* sql - string, an SQL query to execute.

Executes SQL query.
Returns FBResult object in case of success. Raises error otherwise.

* * *
    function query(sql, callback);

* sql - string, an SQL query to execute;
* callback - function(err,res), err - is error object or null, res - FBResult object.

Asynchronously executes query.
Returns undefined. 

* * *

### FBResult object

Represents results of SQL query if any. 
    
#### FBResult object members

* * *
    function fetchSync(rowCount, asObject);
    
* rowCount - integer|"all", number of rows to fetch from results;
* asObject - true|false, format of returned rows. When false - methods returns array of array, when true - array of objects.

Synchronously fetches result rows. If you pass "all" as rowCount - it will fetch all result rows. 
If you pass less rowCount than are actually in result, it will return specified number of rows. 
You may call fetchSync multiple times until all rows will be fetched. 
If you specify more rowCount than available it will return only actual number of rows.

* * *
    function fetch(rowCount, asObject, rowCallback, eofCallback);
    
* rowCount - integer|"all", number of rows to fetch from results;
* asObject - true|false, format of returned rows. When false - methods returns array of array, when true - array of objects;
* rowCallback - function(row), row - Array or Object (depends on asObject parameter) representing single row from result;
* eofCallback - function(err,eof), err - Error object in case of error, or null; eof - true | false.

Asynchronously fetches rows one by one. 
rowCallback is called for each fetched row. 
eofCallback is called when whole operation is complete. eof indicates if end of result set was met.
